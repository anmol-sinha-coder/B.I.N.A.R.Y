### Project Overview
----------------------------------

#### The Current Situation 
* The government has given contracts to reputed vendors for distribution of daily eatables and ration among the people who are suffering, during the lockdown, at SUBSIDIZED RATES according to their income.

* The vendors have set up their distribution points throughout the country, but are facing problems in management during distribution, as there are a few workforce available at every distribution point to cater the entire locality, which leads to violation of Social Distancing rule.

* The government has arranged quarters for the homeless people, as they are at a high risk of getting contaminated. But there is no medium at present, to connect them together due to the technological barrier. The citizens are helping the NGOs to locate such people, but at a slow rate.

#### To solve this problem, we are trying to develop application platform which bridges the gap between the distributors and the customers, using a Full fledged Web Application Architecture powered by Machine Learning Models.

### Solution Description
----------------------------------
Problem Statement: 

“Due to COVID-19, a huge number of people in our country are with no food and shelter. How can you use technology to help the authorities solve this problem ?”

Proposed Solution:

1. An application platform which bridges the gap between the distributors and the customers.

2. Using ML algorithms, we are calculating the INCOME INDEX of the customers for understanding their economic condition. This helps us to predict the % of subsidies to be given.

3. The application features the portal where citizens can report homeless people, the information would be immediately transferred to connected NGOs/ organizations.

Uniqueness of The Project:

1. Effective business model. No Direct or Indirect Competitors.

2. Multi language support to cater the diverse population.

3. The INCOME INDEX calculation through the Predictive Analytics can be used in other projects requiring classification according to economic conditions.

4. With the use of Real Time Analytical calculations and QR Code Checkout, the waiting time at the distribution points is lowered, maintaining the SOCIAL DISTANCING rule.

5. Migrant labours stuck in other cities, having their Aadhar Card can avail the service, which is not possible with the current PDS system.

#### Technical Description

<br>


##### Technologies/versions were used

* A MERN Stack Web Application using NGINX as Reverse Proxy and Load Balancer.
* Complete User Interface of the Mobile Application using Adobe XD.
* Utilizing the computation power of Spark for Predictive Analytics.
* Containerizing the Application using Docker for safe and secure deployment on Cloud Engines.

<br>

##### Setup/Installations required to run the solution

* Web Application Dependencies (For WebSite Prototype)
* ML Model Dependancies
